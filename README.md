**Distributed Key-Value Storage built on top of Scala/Akka**

### Why akka
Its a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent applications which comes
with ideas that have been around from some time - actor model.
Besides that it has many welcome features around clustering:

1. load balancing
2. location transparency
3. self maintenance
4. fault tolerance

### System Requirements
JustinDB works with Java 8 and newer.
